    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Creating your own homemade butter is a delightful culinary adventure 
        that connects you with the heart of traditional cooking. With just one 
        ingredient – heavy cream – and a bit of patience, you can transform a 
        humble dairy product into a creamy, velvety spread that elevates every 
        meal it graces. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Begin by pouring the heavy cream into a food processor or stand mixer 
        and blend it until it thickens, eventually reaching the stage where the 
        butterfat separates from the liquid, leaving you with rich, golden butter. 
        This process not only gives you a deeper appreciation for the food you 
        consume but also allows you to customize your butter with herbs, spices, 
        or even a touch of honey, making it uniquely yours. The satisfaction that 
        comes from spreading your homemade creation on warm, fresh bread, or using 
        it to enhance the flavors of your favorite dishes, is unparalleled. 
        Homemade butter is more than just a condiment; it's a labor of love that 
        turns a simple meal into a culinary masterpiece.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons ice water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the cold cream into your food processor. You can also use an 
            electric whisk or stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream until it separates. After around 2 ½ minutes you will 
            see it start to over whip and really thicken. Keep going. After around 
            4 minutes it should be fully separated. You can see yellow buttery 
            solids and cloudy liquid at this point.</li>
        <li>Once it separates pour in your ice-cold water. This helps separate the 
            butter fully separate from the liquid (buttermilk) and you will see 
            even more buttermilk appear.</li>
        <li>Place a sieve over a bowl and pour in the contents of the bowl.</li>
        <li>The remaining liquid is buttermilk, you can save this for baking or for 
            meat marinade</li>
        <li>Squeeze the butter solids with your hands to make sure no buttermilk
            remains. You can also use a clean tea towl or cheese cloth.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in some salt, this recipe creates 300g of butter</li>
        <li>Can be stored for up to 6 weeks in the fridge.</li>
