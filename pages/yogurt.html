    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Homemade yogurt is a testament to the simplicity and purity of 
        homemade goodness. Crafted from just two ingredients – milk and a 
        spoonful of yogurt culture – this creamy delight takes you on a 
        journey from basic pantry staples to a wholesome, probiotic-rich treat. 
        The process begins with gently heating the milk, allowing its natural 
        sugars to caramelize and create that signature creamy texture. 
        After cooling the milk to just the right temperature, the addition of a 
        small amount of yogurt culture kickstarts the fermentation magic. 
        Patiently incubating this mixture overnight results in a velvety, 
        tangy yogurt that far surpasses its store-bought counterparts.

        Homemade yogurt not only provides a canvas for your culinary creativity, 
        pairing beautifully with fresh fruits, granola, or honey, but it also 
        offers a sense of accomplishment, reminding you that some of life's 
        most satisfying indulgences can be created right in your own kitchen.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1L milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place milk into a large saucepan on medium-high heat, cook it until it reaches
             180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Stir occasionally to 
             prevent scorching. Keep the milk on the stove for 5-7 minutes. Let it cool
              to 115 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together 1 cup milk and the yogurt. Stir this into the remaining milk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the yogurt ferment. Transfer to a 1L glass container and wrap it without a 
            lid in 2 clean kitchen towels, completely covering sides and top. Let stand in 
            a warm place until it reaches the consistency of custard. This may take 5 hours 
            to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refrigerate uncovered jar; when it feels cool (should take roughly 30 min) then 
            screw on a tight fitting lid
        </li>
        <li>
            You can then reuse this yogurt and repeat the process to create more yogurt!
        </li>
    </ol>
